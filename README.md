Mutual information from the feild of information theory is the application of information gain(typically used in the construction of decision treees) to feature selection. Mutual information is calcilated between
two variables and measures the reduction in uncertainly for one variable given a known value of the other variable, Th escikit-learn machine learning libraru provide an implementation for feature selection via the 
mutual_info_classif() and in the next steps  we prints the scores calculated for each input feature and the target variableand then we use A bar chart of feature importance scores for each input feature is created,
Importance a diffrent mixture of features is promoted.
